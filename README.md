# Brew
##A Modern Magento Boilerplate To 'Brew' Your Ecommerce Sites

------------

**Currently in development not recommended for production use**

The purpose of *Brew* is to provide a simple starting point for most magento developments.

It's objectives are:

- Adhere, where possible to OOCSS principles, and more specifically SMACSS naming conventions.
- Seperate Magentos default beastly stylesheets into SCSS partials for easy management and scalability
- To provide a launchpad not a framework for development, all the stuff you want without being told what to do.


##About Me

---------------------------

Currently working at Teabag Studios have been building magento sites for the past 3 years. Frustrated by 'quick wins' and unmaintained best practices I am hoping to author here, with other peoples help, a great resource for people coming to magento to start working with.

The "Brew" name is a nod to Teabag Studios ( www.teabagstudios.com ) where I initially started the project. 

Any questions I'm on twitter @ryanhyslop
